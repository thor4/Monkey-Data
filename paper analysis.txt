1. use create_3d_data_structs.m to create .mat files for betty and clark containing all "good" trials shifted to a -500ms start time. That is, 500ms before sample onset. Now new trial_info markers/triggers are contained within new .mat files and start with a 501ms sample onset (CueOnset). Also saved recording_info into new .mat files. [good_trials-betty.mat & good_trials-clark.mat]
[upload data files to koko for processing]
2. create analytic (time-frequency) signal using chronux for frequency bins: 2-60Hz (500ms window, 50ms step), 61-120Hz (200ms window, 20ms step), 121-180Hz (100ms window, 10ms step), 181-240Hz (50ms window, 5ms step). This will create 4 separate traces/spectrograms per trial per session per day. Save all within the same .mat file, try to append within trial cell {eg: t32}
