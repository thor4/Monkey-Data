%function for ping rejection
%data should be a matrix of instances(trials) x samples(time)
%upper and lower are the bounds within which data will be kept
%they are measured in terms of the sample metric (microvolts in LFP data)
function noping = ping_rej(data,upper,lower)
    %this will average across all baseline samples for each instance
    norm = data - mean(baseline,2);
